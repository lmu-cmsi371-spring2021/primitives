**CMSI 371** Computer Graphics, Spring 2021

# Primitives & Filters Sample Code
This is a public copy of the sample/starter code that comes with the primitives/filters assignment.

For convenience, the graphics code is “wrapped” within a standard-issue React app. You can get it going with:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

-or-

```
npm install
npm start
```
